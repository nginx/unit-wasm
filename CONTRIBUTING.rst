Getting Started
---------------

Check out the `README <README.md>`__.

Ask a Question
--------------

Please open an `issue <https://github.com/nginx/unit-wasm/issues/new>`__
on GitHub with the label ``question``. You can also ask a question on
`Slack <https://nginxcommunity.slack.com>`__ or the NGINX Unit mailing
list, unit@nginx.org (subscribe
`here <https://mailman.nginx.org/mailman3/lists/unit.nginx.org/>`__).

Contributing
------------

Report a Bug
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under
`Issues <https://github.com/nginx/unit-wasm/issues>`__.

If the bug is a potential security vulnerability, please report using
our `security
policy <https://unit.nginx.org/troubleshooting/#getting-support>`__.

To report a non-security bug, open an
`issue <https://github.com/nginx/unit-wasm/issues/new>`__ on GitHub with
the label ``bug``. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as
much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an
executable test case showing the expected behavior that doesn’t occur.

Suggest an Enhancement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To suggest an enhancement, open an
`issue <https://github.com/nginx/unit-wasm/issues/new>`__ on GitHub with
the label ``enhancement``. Please do this before implementing a new
feature to discuss the feature first.

Open a Pull Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone the repo, create a branch, and submit a PR when your changes are
tested and ready for review. Again, if you’d like to implement a new
feature, please consider creating a feature request issue first to start
a discussion about the feature.

Git Style Guide
---------------

-  Split your work into multiple commits is necessary. Each commit
   should make one logical change. I.e don’t mix code re-formatting with
   a fix in the same commit.

-  Subject lines should be short (around 50 characters, not a hard rule)
   and concisely describe the change.

-  The commit message body should be limited to 72 character lines.

-  You can use subject line prefixes for commits that affect a specific
   portion of the code; examples include “libunit-wasm:” and
   “rust-bindings:”.

-  Reference issues and PRs at the end of the commit messages, e.g if
   the commit remedies a GitHub issue add a tag like

   Closes: https://github.com/nginx/unit-wasm/issues/NNN

   If the commit fixes an issue introduced in a previous commit use the
   “Fixes” tag to reference it, e.g

   Fixes: abbrev commit id (“Commit subject line”)
